    "\n",
    "### **Background and Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "EEG signals provide valuable information about brain activity and are often used in medical research to predict outcomes, such as the recovery potential of patients. However, the high dimensionality and complexity of raw EEG data present significant challenges for effective analysis. To address these challenges, we explored the use of a CNN-based Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to extract low-dimensional latent features from 5-minute smoothed EEG signals. These features are subsequently classified using machine learning models (e.g., SVM, XGBoost) to predict patient recovery outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for this approach stems from:\n",
    "1. The need for dimensionality reduction to simplify complex data while retaining critical information.\n",
    "2. Improving classification performance by identifying a compact and representative feature space.\n",
    "3. Leveraging unsupervised learning (VAE) to enhance feature generalizability across patient data.\n",

    "# Contrastive Learning-Based Feature Extraction and Classification for EEG Signals: Report\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals are valuable tools for studying brain activity, especially in predicting patient recovery outcomes. However, the high dimensionality and complexity of EEG data pose significant challenges for analysis and modeling. Initially, we explored Autoencoder-based approaches, but their reconstruction-oriented objectives failed to directly improve classification performance, particularly in scenarios with severe class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The limitations of Autoencoder methods are as follows:\n",
    "1. **Unclear task alignment**: Autoencoders optimize for signal reconstruction, which does not directly enhance classification performance.\n",
    "2. **Limited class differentiation**: The latent space does not explicitly encode differences between classes, resulting in poor separability for Good Outcome and Bad Outcome samples.\n",
    "3. **Weak adaptation to class imbalance**: Autoencoders tend to focus on majority class features, neglecting minority class characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these issues, we turned to contrastive learning, which explicitly optimizes the similarity between positive pairs (samples from the same class) and the dissimilarity between negative pairs (samples from different classes). This approach enhances the discriminative power of the latent features, particularly under class imbalance conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - **Input data**: 5-minute EEG signal segments labeled based on patient recovery outcomes (Good Outcome or Bad Outcome).\n",
    "   - **Normalization**: Signals were standardized to ensure consistent scaling across samples.\n",
    "   - **Length adjustment**: Signals shorter than 1139 data points were padded with `-1`, while longer signals were truncated to 1139 points for uniform input length.\n",
    "   - **Class distribution**: The dataset exhibited significant class imbalance, with fewer Good Outcome samples than Bad Outcome samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Label Mapping**:\n",
    "   - Recovery outcomes were binarized: Good Outcome labeled as `1` and Bad Outcome labeled as `0`.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Contrastive Learning Dataset Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Generation**:\n",
    "  - Each signal was treated as an anchor, with one positive sample (from the same class) and one negative sample (from a different class) dynamically generated for training.\n",
    "  - Random sampling ensured diversity in positive and negative pairs.\n",
    "- **Class Imbalance Mitigation**:\n",
    "  - Due to the lower number of Good Outcome samples, negative pairs involving the majority class were generated more frequently to enhance minority class feature learning.\n",
